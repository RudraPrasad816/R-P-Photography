6. PROCEDURE:
    I.      The first step is to bring all the content at the center of our page we will take a main tag or a section tag that will contain all the tags insidit. make this section a flex box and use justify content center to bring all the contents inside it to the center.

    II.     create a division that will contain the first page. The first page has two division side by side where one contains your name of your project and a button with a achor tag that will bring bottom where one can see all our works; and the right division contains the cover photo.

    III.    After the home page we can start with a heading MY Works and some divisions where I have displayed all my works one by one with their details at the bottom using ing tag and p tags

    IV.     At the End of the page there should be a footer section contains the details of the photographer Here it's I only And some social media handle to users if anyone like your work he/she can follow you. Those social media handle should be shown as a icon of that social media to make it looks great.

    V.      Here you are complete with your project but This project we made is only for desktop pages. We have to make it responsive, i.e. our page should behave properly in any devices. Therefore, we have to use media queries for different width of devices like width of phone is 499px and for tab this would be 768px.

    VI.     While using media query remember if we design the home page same for phones then the two side by side divisions will get very narrow and all the content will now look ugly. To make is looks good we just have to add a css property in the home page that flex-direction : column.
    This will change the two side by side divisions to top and bottom divisions which will look great.
